A headline in the local newspaper about some disappearances in the area caght his eye, so he called Dean (Jensen Ackles) to help him investigate the case. Dean knew he needed to keep Sam/Ezekiel (Jared Padaleck) away from Castiel, so he told Sam that he and Kevin (guest star Osric Chau) needed to stay and worked with Crowley to decipher the tablet. Crowley agreed to help Sam and Kevin but in return he wanted one phone call to hell.</p><p>On tonight’s show Dean (Jensen Ackles) gets a call from an old friend named Sonny (guest star Blake Gibbons) asking for help with a ghost. Sonny runs a home for delinquent boys, and Dean was sent there for stealing food when he was younger. Sam (Jared Padalecki) is stunned he never knew this about his brother and asks for more information, but Dean dodges his questions. Another murder occurs while Sam and Dean are at the house, so they scramble to find the culprit before anyone else dies. Meanwhile, Dean looks up an old girlfriend (guest star Erin Karpluk) and recalls his time at the house.</p><p>Tonight’s episode looks like it is going to be great and you won’t want to miss it, so be sure to tune in for our live coverage of CW’s Supernatural at 9:00 PM EST! While you wait for our recap hit the comments and let us know what you thought of last week’s episode?</p><p><strong>&nbsp;Tonight’s episode begins now – Refresh Page for Updates</strong></p><p>Hurleyville, New York. Two young boys run through the woods. Someone is right behind them – chasing them. They run into an old barn and cower. The barn door opens and it’s a… wimpy kid with glasses who says the barn is a no-go for hide and seek. An older man comes in the barn and tells them it’s time for lights out. He hears a noise and is creeped out. His breath turns cold and fogs up the air. Then his flashlight flickers off and the tractor cranks itself. It plows him down – pun intended – and drives spikes through him, impaling him to the wall.</p><p>Sam comes into the bunker library looking for Dean and Kevin and finds neither. He selects a book – Baum’s Oz – and sits down to read. Dean’s phone vibrates on the table and Sam answers it. He says there is no “D-dog” there but then Dean comes in and snatches the phone. He tells the person – Sonny – he’ll be there as soon as he can.</p><p>Dean asks Sam if he remembers when their Dad was off chasing Ruga Ru and they crashed at the place in upstate New York. Sam says he remembers that Dean got lost for a couple of months. Dean tells him that was a story they made up for him. Dean says he gambled away their food money and then got busted for stealing and was sent to a work farm for a couple of months. Sonny is the guy who ran it and he knows what they do.</p><p>Dean asks if “everybody” is okay that they head out to the Catskills to investigate and Sam says he is everyone. I think he was waiting to see if Zeke would protest. Sam doesn’t understand why Dean would have let the lie stand all these years and doesn’t offer him a good explanation. Dean says that their dad knew he was at the work farm but left him there to learn a lesson. Dean says it wasn’t his dad’s fault.</p><p>They come to the door of Sonny’s Home for Boys and Ruth answers. She asks if they’re prison buddies of Sonny’s. She tells them to take off their boots before they walk on her clean floor. Dean looks at the sofa and sees a flashback of a young Dean sitting there. The cop tells him the kid was busted stealing peanut butter and bread and that his dad said to let him rot. Sonny takes off the handcuffs and sees bruises on Dean’s arm – he asks where he got them and he says from a werewolf. Dean asks what kind of place this is and Sonny says it’s for boys like him to learn to work hard and stay out of trouble and that it’s better than jail.</p><p>Back in the now, a much older Sonny comes in and hugs him. He says he’s only got a handful of boys working anymore because the court system would rather put them in jail than rehabilitate them. He tells Dean that the old dead tractor suddenly came to life and ran over Jack – his old leathery sidekick. They ask if it could have slipped out of park and he says no. He says that weird things have been happening. Windows and door slamming, noises from inside the walls…</p><p>Dean goes to check out the barn and tells Sam to check the house while Sonny rounds up the boys for them to talk to. Sam notices a pentagram carved on one of the beds. He peels away years of duct tape with names scrawled on them until he gets down to Dean W. Suddenly the door opens and there is the sound of whispering in a foreign language. He opens the door and it’s just Ruth on her knees praying. She says she was praying for the ghost that haunts the farm to leave.</p><p>In the barn, Dean heads in and hears only birds cooing. He pulls out his ghost detector but comes up empty. He puts it away and heads deeper in to investigate strange giggly sounds. He slides open another door deeper in the barn and calls out hello. There’s a lightbulb swinging on a chain and then suddenly there’s a boy there. A scrawny boy with glasses. He says he’s fighting monsters using Bruce the monster smasher. He’s got an action figure that says “I clobber evil.” The boy says his name is Timmy and they shake.</p><p>Dean tells him to give him his best kung fu grip and stare him straight in the eye. He says he’ll do well shaking like that. He asks Timmy if he knew Jack and he tells him he yelled a lot and was yelling when he had the accident. He says he and the other boys were playing in the barn when it happened. He tells Dean it got really cold before it happened. Timmy says he needs to go do chores before Ruth gets mad and scampers away.</p><p>Ruth tells Sam that she grew up in the town and knows the people who used to own the farm. She says the owner would drink heavily and one night he went crazy and tried to kill his wife and Jack (the now-dead handyman). Jack got away but he killed his wife with a cleaver. She tells him that Howard (the killer) died in jail.</p><p>The brothers head to the cemetery to see if good old Howard is still dead so they can burn his bones to exorcise his ghost. Sam is concerned about Dean’s time at the work farm but he insists he was never treated badly there. They salt the corpse and toss in a match. He goes up nice and crispy.</p><p>Meanwhile back at the farm, Ruth relaxes in a hot bath. Then the lights flicker and the mirror ices over. She exhales with icy breath. The shower curtain is ripped down and covers her face smothering her. Ava Maria plays dramatically. Sonny hears her struggle and tries to break in but the door holds fast. Then it’s too late and she’s dead…</p><p>Dean and Sam sit at Cus’s Place – a local diner. Sam says they can get a go-burger but Dean tells him he has to try the best pancakes in the world. Flashback to Sonny taking Dean out for a meal at a local diner as a teen. Sonny says he can stay at the farm as long as he wants since his dad hasn’t turned out. He tells Dean he’s proud of the good grades and how well he’s settled in.</p><p>Then he asks Dean about the occult symbols carved on his bed and the salt he sprinkles around his bunk. Dean says it’s a family thing and Sonny asks if he’s in the mob or something – Dean says “or something.” Sonny tells him he fell in with a gang once and that it didn’t work out well for him. He tells him he needs to be his own man. A girl comes to take their order – Robin.</p><p>Back in the present, Robin again comes to take their order. She says she doesn’t remember him even after he reminds her about the times he would come up there. She looks uncomfortable and gets called away and then Dean drags him out of the diner. He gets a call from Sonny and they head back to the farm. Sonny tells him the door wouldn’t open even though there are no locks on the doors.</p><p>Dean asks if there’s anything else weird he can remember. He says Ruth always had her rosary beads with her but now they can’t find them. They agree to dig in more. Dean finds some of the bigger boys bullying Timmy. Dean demands to know where they were when Ruth had her accident. They say they don’t have to answer unless he’s a cop and he flashes his fake FBI badge. The boys say they were in town. They also say the only thing weird they’ve seen is Timmy. Dean tells them if they touch Timmy again he’s going to go Guantanamo on them. They run off and he tells Timmy he has to stand up to them.</p><p>Sonny shows Sam a wall of awards from the boys over the years and points to one of Dean’s for being county wrestling champion. A car pulls up and it’s Robin. She gets out and brings her guitar in for a lesson. The boys watch her come in. One is having a problem with the lawn mower. He turns it off and flips it over and finds Ruth’s rosary beads tangled in it. Timmy watches from the window as the boy puts his hands on the blade to pull them off. The mower flips on and the boy screams. We see blood spray everywhere. An old woman’s hand comes to rest on Timmy’s shoulder as he stands in the window…</p><p>Sam studies Timmy’s file as Dean comes in and tells him the boy will need about a 1,000 stitches. They note that he was bullying Timmy right before he got hurt. Sam tells him Timmy was found alone in an abandoned building. They can’t find his parents and Sonny took him in. Dean says he’s not a Damien but he may be possessed by a ghost. They wonder if they should force feed him salt.</p><p>Sam heads out to check out the barn while Dean takes the house. He goes deep in until he finds a roof compartment. He goes up in it and finds marker drawings on the wall that say mom and show a fiery car accident.</p><p>Dean comes in and sees Robin strumming her guitar. Flashback to when they were teens and she’s asking him about traveling so much. He says it’s for his dad’s work and she asks if he likes it and he says he doesn’t but his dad expects him to take over. She says her dad wants her to take over the diner but she wants to travel and be a photographer. He tells her he wants to be a mechanic and a rock star. He tells her that fixing a car is like a puzzle. She kisses him. Then she asks if he’s kissed many girls and he tries to play it cool. She doesn’t believe him. She says they need to keep practicing and kisses him again.</p><p>Back to the present, Robin sees Dean staring at her. She’s there to give Timmy a lesson but he tells her she needs to leave right then. He tells her she does remember him and she asks how she could forget. Flashback to them kissing and he promises her he won’t be going anywhere. He asks her to the school dance. She says yes and kisses him. In the present, Dean tells her he can’t explain what happened then and has to get her out of there.</p><p>The door slams shut. Timmy is there and says he’s sorry and he can’t stop it. Glass begins shattering everywhere. Sam runs in and Dean tosses him a box of salt and tells him to make a circle. Timmy tells them he can’t control “her.” Sam asks if it’s his mom. He asks him to tell him about the fire. Timmy says they were driving late and crashed in the woods. He says his mother saved him by pushing him out of the car before it blew up with her in it.</p><p>Sam asks what happened next. He says he ran through the woods and found an empty building. He cried for his mom and she came. But she had changed into something dark. Dean asks if his mom gave him the cool action figure. Sam asks him for the doll. The ghost appears and slams Sam into the wall. Dean turns on the gas and burns the toy. A breeze blows through the curtains and the salt circle breaks. Sam tells him it wasn’t the doll – she’s anchored onto Timmy!</p><p>Sam says Timmy’s mom can’t let go and she attacks everyone. Robin runs out of the kitchen and Dean stops her. She asks who she is and he says he’s the one thing keeping her safe. The ghost knocks Dean down and chokes him. Then she disappears and reappears where Sam is talking to Dean. She throws both of the guys back. Timmy says he can’t control her. Dean says he has to let her go. He tells him she’s a ghost who is going crazy because she can’t move on.</p><p>Dean tells him he has to do what’s best for him even if it hurts someone he loves. She continues choking Dean and Timmy demands that she stop. He tells her that he’ll be okay but she has to go away and not come back. The grey ghost ick breaks away and we see his mom as she was before the accident. She cries. Timmy tells her he loves her and she dissolves into light and disappears. Timmy runs to Dean and hugs him tight.</p><p>Robin is shocked to learn that ghostbusting is Dean’s family business. He tells her he didn’t’ get to run off and be a rock star and she tells him he looked pretty rocking to her. She says she’s happy taking over her dad’s diner and Dean said it looks like they didn’t know everything at 16 and she agrees but says they knew some things. She kisses his cheek then heads back into the house with Ruth.</p><p>Sonny tells him that Timmy will need some adjusting but Dean says he’s sure Sonny’s up to the job. Sonny tells him he’ll see him later. Sam asks how Dean knew that asking Timmy to get his mom to leave would work and he says he got lucky. Sam says he got lucky with his time as a kid on Sonny’s ranch. Dean says the place wasn’t a fit for him and he couldn’t wait to leave.</p><p>Flashback to teen Dean getting dressed for the school dance. Sonny tells him his old man just showed up. He says he asked John to come back for him later so he could go to the dance but he says his dad told him they have a job and said Dean would know what that meant. Sonny tells him if he wants to stay that he’ll stick his neck out and fight for him to stay. A car honks outside and Dean looks out the window. He sees his little brother Sam in the backseat of the car smiling at him. That makes up his mind. He thanks Sonny for everything and says he has to go.</p><p>Back in the present, Dean looks thoughtfully at the farm house. Sam thanks him. Dean asks for what and Sam says for always being there and having his back. He says he knows it hasn’t always been easy. Dean says he doesn’t know what the hell he’s talking about and peels out of the driveway. Aww….</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaGxno6q9pr7NmquuqpGherOxwpqnZmlhZoZyf4ysnJqrn6N6ennEqaCsp5Saenh5wZqbZpqfrsBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
