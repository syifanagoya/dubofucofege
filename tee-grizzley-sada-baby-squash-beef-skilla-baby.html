That’s all who was on there. At the time, he wasn’t offering me to get on the song. He just let me hear it. I was like, that’s cool. I liked it.</p><p>He continued: “Immediately, I felt I would fuck him up [Tee Grizzley] on that bitch because he was saying some bullshit. But I wasn’t tripping. I was cool with the fact that he let me hear his album before it came out. So I didn’t give a fuck if he was going to include me in it or not. I can guarantee you every fucking body on that song ain’t sat in this seat right here and listened to his whole album.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I’m not saying that I don’t know if I wouldn’t have did it if I had heard the other verses first, but I think he’s smart enough to have let me do my shit first before adding the people he added.
