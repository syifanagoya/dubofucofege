He made a name for himself playing for various National Basketball Association (NBA) teams such as the Boston Celtics, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Dallas Mavericks. His college basketball stint at Saint Joseph’s University also contributed significantly to his current net worth.</p><p>By mid-2016, Delonte West’s net worth was estimated at $100,000, primarily amassed through a basketball career. Despite signing lucrative contracts, his net worth remained lower compared to most players, supposedly due to his controversial career. Whether his wealth increases in the future remains to be seen.</p><h3>Delonte West Net Worth $100,000</h3><p>Delonte’s basketball skills gained prominence during his time at Eleanor Roosevelt High School. He played a crucial role in the school’s team reaching the Maryland 4A championship. Despite losing, West received several honors and awards for his outstanding performance. He continued his basketball journey at Saint Joseph’s University, where he played alongside Jameer Nelson, contributing to the team’s remarkable season record and an Elite Eight NCAA Tournament appearance.</p><p>Entering the 2004 NBA Draft after his junior year at Saint Joseph’s, he was chosen as the 24th overall pick by the Boston Celtics. Despite initial struggles due to injuries, West’s determination saw him excel in the subsequent years. He then moved to the Seattle Supersonics and later to the Cleveland Cavaliers, where he showcased remarkable performances.</p><p>Signing a three-year $12.7 million extension in 2008 significantly boosted his net worth. Despite subsequent declines in his averages, West’s journey took him to various teams, including the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Dallas Mavericks. His career eventually led him to the NBA D-League and playing overseas in China and Venezuela.</p><p>Personal challenges marred Delonte’s life, as he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, faced legal issues for carrying firearms, and was rumored to have had an inappropriate relationship, affecting his reputation. Despite these challenges, he continued his basketball journey with unwavering determination.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Facts</li><li>Filmography</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Delonte West</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$100,000</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>1.223&nbsp;million USD</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 26, 1983</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Washington, D.C., United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft 3 in (1.91 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>181 lbs (82 kg)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>American Professional Basketball player for NBA</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Eleanor Roosevelt High School, Saint Joseph’s University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Caressa Suzzette Madden (m. 2013)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Cash West</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Dmitri West, Delphina Addison</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Dmitri West Jr., Danielle West</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>https://twitter.com/charleeredz13</a></td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>www.imdb.com/name/nm2715960</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Elite Eight NCAA Tournament</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>Third-team All-American – NABC, TSN (2004), First-team All-Atlantic(2003, 2004)</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=interesting_facts><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Signed as a free agent by the Boston Celtics.
