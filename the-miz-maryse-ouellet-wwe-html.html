He called Miz a "showoff" and&nbsp;mocked his "me first" attitude.</p><p>Adding to this, Edge opined that while being a talented superstar, Miz lacked the right attitude, unlike himself.</p><p>Towards the end of his speech, he talked about not taking their face-off lightly and hinting at what he was planning to do to him. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>'I'm going to knock that constipated look off your face…," said Edge, while also promising to teach him a few lessons at Day 1 of Miz's pay-per-view match.</p><h2>The Miz Used Wife Maryse Ouellet as a Human Shield</h2><p>After being at the receiving end of pretty heavy disrespect, Miz was frustrated. And he took this out on Edge.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He splashed his champagne on Edge's face. Distracted by that, Edge could not defend himself.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>He fell down but got back up just as quickly. However, he did not take time to set up his signature move, Spear.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Miz, on the other hand, wasn't well-prepared for the attack. So, he used Maryse instead.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The future Hall of Fame inductee used his wife as a human shield. This blindsided Edge, who could not get to Miz.</p><p>Hiding behind Maryse, Miz then delivered a kick to Edge's head and put the altercation to an end with his signature move, the Skull Crushing Finale. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>After finishing Edge off, Miz kissed his wife on the cheeks, caught and raised their hands,&nbsp;and began celebrating his victory.</p><p>Maryse, however, was not impressed.</p><p>She began arguing with him in the middle of the ring. Finally, after exchanging a few words, she looked like she had&nbsp;had enough of him for the time being.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>So, she slapped&nbsp;her husband right square in the face.</p><p>As for Miz, he looks perplexed at what had just happened.</p><p>The couple's show ends as she storms off backstage, clearly not happy with her husband's actions. Miz runs behind her&nbsp;requesting her not to be angry at him. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyYmnqutdlmpJqqqaiybrvUnqOlnaRixLixjaGrpqQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
