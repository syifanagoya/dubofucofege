She has two siblings, Freddie Knight, and Katie Hudson. &nbsp;She came from poor family background and had to take care of her brother. &nbsp;Katie was born during the period of her disappearance.

To make a hot meal, she would resort to using a heater just to make a hot dog.</p><p>She had a pretty rough upbringing that led her to run away from home once as a teenager. Knight slept in a garbage can wondering where her next meal would come from.&nbsp; If that was not enough, she underwent the trauma of being sexually molested and raped by a male relative when she was just a young girl.</p><p>She eventually resorted to going back home after spending a few nights out in the cold and hungry.
