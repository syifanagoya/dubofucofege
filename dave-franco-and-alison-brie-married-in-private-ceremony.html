"I don't even know if I want to get married," she said. "I've never been the girl who's planning my dream wedding - I was always practicing my speech for the Oscars. That was my dream, which is kind of sad but kind of great. Our parents got married because it was expected of them. Even my parents, who are hippies, felt some kind of pressure, I'm sure. I don't know that I'm the marrying kind. It's hard to work in an industry that changes from minute to minute and then lock into thinking of something as forever. It's kind of daunting. Maybe I just haven't met the right guy yet - that's the flip side," she added.</p><p id=e8EHYd2iRugGN data-wc=12><span><strong>GALLERY: The next big thing: A closer look at Hollywood's rising stars</strong></span></p><p id=eM8FbyLOlLyLH data-wc=99>After becoming engaged, Alison spoke to about how meeting Dave had changed her mind. "I'm not very bridal, instinctually," she explained. "Marriage never really interested me, I guess because I was very focused on my work. I wasn't sure if I really saw the point to it. I just met that person that I was like, 'Well, I'm really in love with you and would like to grow old with you. I actually think it's much more romantic when two people are like, 'Oh, I could go either way on marriage, but I want to marry you.'"</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
