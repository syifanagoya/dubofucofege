The team had hoped to trade him or buy out his contract but eventually waived him after those attempts failed.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The Knicks will be able to use the stretch provision on the remaining year of Noah's contract to soften his effect on the salary cap. But that doesn't change the fact that they'll still pay him the full $72 million of his four-year deal.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>That means Noah will make $1,358,491 </span><b>per game </b><span style=font-weight:400>he played in New York.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-270661 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/GettyImages-633456628.jpg alt width=900 height=722 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-270661 class=wp-caption-text>Al Bello/Getty Images</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Because of the stretch provision, the Knicks will save $12.9 million towards the salary cap next off season. However, the Knicks will also lose $6.4 million in cap space in 2020 and 2021.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Noah missed time due to a knee injury and received a suspension after taking a banned substance and had been separated from the team since February. He and Knicks coach <a href=# title="Jeff Hornacek Net Worth">Jeff Hornacek</a> often butted heads and even had to be physically separated during practice.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The verbal altercation with Hornacek proved to be the final straw. Noah only played in seven games last season, averaging career lows in minutes, points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The New York Post called the Noah deal the worst in franchise history. Between that and </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span style=font-weight:400>Bobby Bonilla's long-term deal</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> with the Mets, it seems like New York is the best place for an aging veteran to sign.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjqOmmqOZonqvu8ChZKaZlJp6rrvRnmStoJGjenJ5kmakoqScnryvec%2BeqWafkaKybrLOq2StoJViuK%2B1wqSqaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
