News reported in April of that year that Efron and the 26-year-old The Orville actress were an item. But, by July, the former Disney Channel star was single again.</p><p>Efron and Bro first sparked dating rumors in early 2019 when they were spotted together in January at a fitness class in Los Angeles. In March, the duo attended an Ultimate Fighting Championship match in Las Vegas, as well as a Los Angeles Kings game. Us Weekly confirmed they were a couple at that time.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B5lE4OgBEur/</p><p>This abrupt change in Efron’s personal life comes just weeks after the actor suffered a serious health scare while filming his new adventure series Killing Zac Efron in Papua New Guinea. Efron reportedly suffered from a serious bacterial infection that put him in the hospital, but he ended up making a full recovery.</p><p>Zac Efron wrote on Instagram that he did get sick, but bounced back quick and finished an amazing three weeks of shooting. Efron thanked everyone who had reached out to him, and then he added that he was heading home for the holidays and would see everyone in 2020.</p><p>Some High School Musical fans recently started shipping Efron and his co-star Vanessa Hudgens hard after she split from her boyfriend of nine years, Austin Butler. Efron and Hudgens dated for five years during their Disney days, but split in 2010.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Since then, Zac Efron has been linked to Michelle Rodriguez, Sami Miro, Alexandra Daddario, and Rebecca Ferguson, in addition to Sarah Bro and Halston Sage.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeqlrBuscWrpqdlmah6pa3ToqWgZZ6atqi0waiprGWTpHq0wMCrZKGZnKjBsLqMrJignV2Ws7Wx0WaqqaSZqXqnvs6mZKyZopa1bq7RqGRsbmRqgHl7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
