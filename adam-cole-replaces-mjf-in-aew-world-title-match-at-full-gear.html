The main event of the night was supposed to see MJF face Jay White with the World Title on the line, but Tony Khan had other plans.</p><p><a href=#>Ringside News provided full coverage of AEW Full Gear</a>. It was quite a show, and there was no shortage of talking points throughout the event.</p><p>MJF and Adam Cole currently hold the ROH Tag Team Championships. Unfortunately, Cole is currently sidelined due to an injury. Nevertheless, MJF managed to find a new tag team partner for the upcoming Full Gear event.</p><p>During the AEW Full Gear Zero-Hour show, MJF teamed up with Samoa Joe to take on The Gunns in an exciting tag team bout. The Gunns, who were part of Bullet Club gold, came into the match with significant momentum. As the show began at the Kia Forum, the crowd was filling up, and chants for MJF and Joe echoed throughout the arena.</p><p>The match was intense, with both teams showcasing their skills. At one point, Samoa Joe and MJF attempted to execute stereo Muscle Buster moves, but The Gunns managed to evade the moves. Then Joe was able to get a submission win with a Coquina Clutch as Adam Cole surprised everyone by showing up.</p><p>After the match, the Gunns beat MJF down, and they hit him in the knee several times with a chair. That laid the champion out, and Adam Cole was unable to stop them. He was on crutches, and rocked a full beard.</p><p>Before MJF was led off by the medical team, he made Adam Cole promise that he won’t let them take his title from him. That resulted in Cole having to step up.</p><p>Tony Schiavone came out later with Jay White, and just as he was about to make White the champion, because MJF can’t compete, Cole came out to take MJF’s place.</p><p>This led Tony Khan to send out a tweet to make the change official. The main even of AEW Full Gear is now Adam Cole vs Jay White with the World Title on the line.</p><p>With MJF hospitalized and unable to defend the AEW Title tonight, his partner Adam Cole has volunteered to step in to fight the main event, it will be Jay White vs Adam Cole!</p><p>Adam Cole just had surgery on his ankle thanks to that injury he sustained at AEW Grand Slam. He is not medically cleared to compete, but he still has a main event match now against Jay White.</p><p>We will have to see how this situation turns out. MJF may be in an interesting position at the end of Full Gear.
