Recommended Videos The actor reveals his distaste for the persistent rumor in a new article published by Screen Rant. He was talking to the publication to promote his role in the social media black comedy satire Not Okay, and says part of the film’s message can be taken in with his experience with scores of anonymous accounts online which made up something which ultimately did not come true."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I’m glad that time has passed and people can see that I was telling the truth. There was so much doubt and speculation and theories and all just from, I don’t even know who originally put… I think that they just post s—t. They have no source. It doesn’t come from anything. It’s crazy actually to see it catch fire. That’s not really fair, is it? It is [like the message of&nbsp;Not Okay]. Yeah. I mean, it was like an account that has a following. It’s somewhat of a credible source and they’re just making s—t up. That’s interesting, isn’t it?”</p><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>Of course, public figures can and do lie about what they are working on (does anyone remember Andrew Garfield?) and O’Brien says he is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">open to playing a superhero someday</a>, but, he does seem genuine in his response here. The 30-year-old is not hurting for work and can be seen next in The Vanishings at Caddo Lake in the future, produced by M. Night Shyamalan.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8Oyo5qmXaSvs7XEp2SsoZOgerCyjJupoqaXYrOiuoycmKysXZbAbrrIoJ%2Btr5mjtHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
