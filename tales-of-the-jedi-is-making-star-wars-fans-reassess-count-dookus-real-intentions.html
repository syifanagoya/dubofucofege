Recommended Videos In the latest animated show featuring six short stories and taking us back in time through the prequel era, Count Dooku slowly becomes disillusioned with the propagated idea that the Jedi are truly keeping peace and justice in the galaxy far, far away."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

With the council not heeding his warnings, Dooku seeks out Darth Sidious in hope of change, but the last straw is when they get Qui-Gon murdered.</p><p data-characters=323 data-current-count=721 data-injectable=true>Dooku completes his transformation to the Dark Side by killing Master Yaddle, thus giving birth to Darth Tyranus. But fans now have reason to believe that Dooku’s alliance with Palpatine was always a reluctant one, and he would’ve betrayed his new master if Obi-Wan Kenobi had been more willing to hear him out.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=#>I don’t get this scene.
