NIN is an 11 digit unique number given to every Nigerian for free; no payment is required. It is a unique number because no Nigerian can have the same number. Everyone has a different number that will identify you for life.</span></p><p><span>The National Identification Number is used to bring together all records or information about an individual, the individual’s fingerprints, demographic information, a picture showing the individual’s face, which usually stops at the shoulder, digital signature, and other biometric data are all useful in helping to </span><span>verify and identify an individual when they are embarking on a journey or making any transaction. In Nigeria, it is mandatory for every citizen, both home and abroad, to get their own unique NIN.</span></p><h2>&nbsp;<strong>How Important is it to have a NIN?</strong></h2><p><span>An individual needs to have the National Identification Number (NIN) because of the following reasons:</span></p><ul><li>To help keep track of actual transactions and movement of people within and outside the country.</li><li>It helps to confirm individuals in actual need of particular Government services, e.g., age and retirement confirmation for pensioners.</li></ul><ul><li><span>To&nbsp;</span>provide accurate records about actual living/dead persons in every region of the country.</li><li><span>An individual can be identified as who they claim to be through the matching information in the individual’s NIN.</span></li><li><span>Individuals that require help (like insurance services, pension, health insurance) from the government can be easily identified.</span></li><li><span>Identifying an individual for banking services, passport issuance, land transactions </span>is easier with NIN as it helps to cut down the time used to check documents to identify the person.</li><li><span>Fraud can be averted.</span></li><li><span>It helps to verify the exact identity of the individual someone wants to employ or run business transactions with.</span></li><li><span>Verifying if a voter is eligible to vote or not.</span></li></ul><h2><strong>How to Check and Retrieve your NIMC Details</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NIN-slip.jpg alt width=696 height=325 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>As earlier stated, NIMC is an&nbsp;<span>acronym for National Identity Management Commission.
