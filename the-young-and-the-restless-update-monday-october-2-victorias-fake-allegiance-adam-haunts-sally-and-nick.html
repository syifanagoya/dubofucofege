After Adam tries to act like heâ€™s all in, Nate wonâ€™t buy it and will voice his distrust.</p><p>In fact, Nate will plan to use his own money and hire a separate assistant for the critical tasks he needs help with.</p><p>Adam will only be allowed to do menial office jobs, but heâ€™ll act like heâ€™s fine with sharpening pencils and will make it clear that heâ€™s in this for the long haul.</p><p>Since itâ€™ll seem like Nateâ€™s trying to rile him up, Adam will warn that Nateâ€™s going to fail if heâ€™s trying to push him to any kind of breaking point.</p><p>Nate will basically admit heâ€™s babysitting Adam for Victor Newman (Eric Braeden), but even that wonâ€™t bring Adam down.</p><p>In Victorâ€™s office, Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle) will act all contrite and insist that she now understands that Daddyâ€™s agenda wasnâ€™t personal.</p><p>Although Victoria will claim sheâ€™s going to be a team player and even give Adam a chance, Victor will hear alarm bells.</p><p>Itâ€™ll seem like Victoria is plotting something, but sheâ€™ll claim sheâ€™s being sincere.</p><p>Next on Mondayâ€™s Y&R episode, Sally Spectra (Courtney Hope) will have a nightmare about Nick Newman (Joshua Morrow) cornering her in the corridor while sheâ€™s kissing Adam.</p><p>Sally wonâ€™t say anything to Nick about that when she awakens and will be overwhelmed when he gushes over how much he loves her.</p><p>Nick will hint that Sally could say sheâ€™s falling in love with him too, but sheâ€™ll need more time to get there.</p><p>Nick will nix his lunch meeting with Victor in favor of a picnic in the park with Sally, but sheâ€™ll give him a nudge to show his dad that he cares.</p><p>Thatâ€™ll convince Nick to call Victor back and plan to meet up for a drink in the evening.</p><p>Later, Sally will let her mind wander as she waits for Nick at the park.</p><p>As Sally imagines kissing Adam in the hallway again, sheâ€™ll also imagine Nick hurling affair accusations and acting like sheâ€™s been leading him on.</p><p>Once Nick shows up and sees Sally looking distraught, sheâ€™ll confess that she kissed Adam and leave him taken aback over the news.</p><p>Back at Newman Enterprises, Victor will speak with Nate privately and seek updates on whether Adam is truly willing to change.</p><p>Nate will voice cautious optimism, but Victor will have his doubts about both Adam and Victoria since theyâ€™re seemingly telling him what he wants to hear.</p><p>Outside Victorâ€™s office, Victoria will lash out at Adam and warn that Nateâ€™s going to expose who he really is.</p><p>However, Adam will plan to expose Victoriaâ€™s true nature instead and will look forward to her downfall.</p><p>Meanwhile, Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott) will be beyond impressed with Claire Grace (Hayley Erin), an assistant job candidate with great energy and a noteworthy educational background.</p><p>What Claire lacks in experience, sheâ€™ll make up for through her research on Newman Media and her eagerness to join the team.</p><p>Claire will also discuss some personal details like her passion for music, parents who perished in a car crash and the great-aunt who raised her in small-town Oregon.</p><p>Although Claire did well at an assistant position in Chicago, sheâ€™ll seem ready for the slower pace of GC and the realness of the town.</p><p>Claire will also get Nikkiâ€™s attention by mentioning Sophia Carmichael since she spent some summer vacations in GC with Sophia, who she knew from college.</p><p>Nikki will recall the Newmans doing some charitable collaborations with Sophiaâ€™s family.</p><p>The interview will pretty much dazzle Nikki from start to finish, so sheâ€™ll eventually give an ecstatic Claire the job.</p><p>Audra Charles (Zuleyka Silver) will be part of this interview process and will privately mention Nikkiâ€™s obvious love for mentoring.</p><p>Nikki will make it clear that she only values a pupil who doesnâ€™t stand in her way, so Audra will realize thatâ€™s a warning.</p><p>The Young and the Restless spoilers say Claire will continue to impress Nikki, but she may have a few tricks up her sleeve!</p><p>CDLâ€™s where you want to be for fantastic <a href=# rel=noopener>Young and the Restless spoilers, updates and news, so make us your favorite Y&R hotspot.</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Will Nickâ€™s breaking point cause a breakup? ðŸ’” <a rel=nofollow href=#>#YR</a> is new this week on <a rel=nofollow href=#>@CBS</a>!
